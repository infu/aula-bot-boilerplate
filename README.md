# Aula Bot Boilerplate
Boilerplate for starting a new Aula bot. The main purpose of bots is to automate tasks.

Bots can obtain information by:
- Proactively browsing
- Reactively listening to streams of real-time updates

Bots can execute actions if they are allowed to by their given roles and permissions
Bots are inherently dissalowed to "like" and "watch".
